PROJECT:HR DATA ANALYSIS DASHBOARD





OBJECTIVE:
The goal of the HR Data Analysis Dashboard is to monitor key HR metrics, such as employee demographics, turnover, attendance, performance, and satisfaction. This helps HR professionals make informed decisions regarding recruitment, retention, and employee engagement strategies.

2. Key Components
An effective HR dashboard includes several core components:

a) Employee Demographics
Headcount by Department: Visualization of employee distribution across different departments.
Gender, Age, and Diversity Breakdown: Charts showing gender, age, and diversity distribution within the company.
Tenure Analysis: Information on employee tenure to assess turnover risk and identify experienced staff.
b) Recruitment and Hiring Metrics
Hiring Trends: Analysis of hires over time, segmented by department, location, or job role.
Time to Hire and Cost per Hire: Track the average time it takes to fill positions and associated hiring costs.
Source of Hire: Identify which recruitment channels (e.g., job boards, referrals) provide the most successful hires.
c) Turnover and Attrition Rates
Attrition Rate: Display monthly or quarterly attrition rates to monitor employee turnover.
Turnover by Department: Identify departments with higher-than-average turnover to target retention efforts.
Exit Reasons: Track the reasons employees leave to understand underlying causes for attrition.
d) Attendance and Absenteeism
Absenteeism Rates: Show absenteeism trends by department or individual to identify potential issues with morale or health.
Leave Utilization: Track various types of leaves (e.g., sick leave, vacation) to see if leave policies meet employee needs.
Overtime Tracking: Measure overtime to understand workload and potential burnout.
e) Performance and Productivity Metrics
Employee Performance Ratings: Track and visualize performance ratings across departments or job roles.
Goals vs. Achievements: Comparison of individual or departmental goals with actual achievements.
Training and Development Metrics: Monitor employee participation in training programs and measure impact on performance.
f) Employee Satisfaction and Engagement
Survey Results: Analyze employee feedback from engagement or satisfaction surveys.
Net Promoter Score (NPS): Measure employee loyalty and likelihood to recommend the company as a place to work.
Engagement Score Trends: Track engagement scores over time to assess the impact of HR initiatives.
3. Data Sources
Data sources for an HR dashboard may include:

HRMS/HRIS Systems: Centralized HR systems that store employee records, performance data, and leave information.
Payroll System: Data for payroll, overtime, and benefits tracking.
Survey Tools: Employee satisfaction and engagement survey results.
Spreadsheets: Additional data sources from department managers or recruitment teams.
4. Data Processing and Transformation
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, ensure data consistency, and remove duplicates.
Data Modeling: Establish relationships between various tables, like employee demographics, attendance, and performance ratings.
Calculated Metrics: Define metrics for turnover rates, absenteeism rates, NPS scores, and cost per hire.
5. Dashboard Design
Interactive Filters: Allow users to filter data by department, job role, gender, or tenure.
Visualizations: Use bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, heat maps, and KPI indicators to represent data clearly.
Drill-Down Functionality: Enable drill-downs to explore metrics at an individual or department level.
6. Insights and Recommendations
The dashboard should help HR teams gain insights such as:

Identifying departments with high turnover or absenteeism.
Analyzing performance and engagement trends to improve morale.
Pinpointing cost-saving opportunities in recruitment or overtime management.
Tracking the success of training programs based on performance metrics.
7. Benefits
Data-Driven HR Decisions: Make informed choices on recruitment, retention, and employee development.
Real-Time Monitoring: Track HR metrics in real-time or on a periodic basis.
Enhanced Employee Experience: Gain a clearer understanding of employee needs and satisfaction.
8. Challenges
Potential challenges in creating an HR dashboard include:

Data Sensitivity: Ensuring that employee data is securely handled to maintain confidentiality.
Data Integration: Merging data from different systems can be complex and may require data transformation.
Real-Time Data Updates: Configuring for real-time data can be challenging, especially when using multiple data sources.
